# Chaitanya Suvarna

Hi, I am Chaitanya - a software developer working at Barclays. I am currently working on microservices developed using .Net and .Net Core frameworks. I like learning and growing as I use my skills to contribute to the outcome.

I am currently learning new technologies with the help of Pluralsight and you'll find my pet projects that I have built to learn these technologies, here on github repositories.

## How I work ðŸ”­
I am always curious about new frameworks and keep creating hands-on demos until I have clarity on the various aspects on the framework. I also strive to achieve clarity of what is to be built, and why is there a need for it. This clarity helps we work better and keeps me motivated throught the process to deliver a quality outcome.
